Assignments
-----------

There is a lot to be learned from the photographic evidence supplied. What in particular did you take away? You might go so far as to consider the potential materials involved and what caused them to look as they do in the picture.

Based on the reading about corrosion, how do your views of the pictures change?

Please prepare a short presentation on the Soggy Furs case and evidence.

Please prepare a short presentation on corrosion.
